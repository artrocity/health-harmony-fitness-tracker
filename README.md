# Health Harmony Fitness Tracker

In today's fast-paced world, managing one's health and fitness often feels overwhelming.People struggle with keeping track of their exercise routines, dietary habits, body weight, and even daily health symptoms.
I personally was diagnosed with POTs (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome). Some days I feel decent and others are a struggle, and there doesn’t seem to be any link to what causes a good or bad day.
To solve this problem, I'm excited to present to you Health Harmony. Health Harmony is going to be a comprehensive fitness tracker which is different from other fitness trackers in the sense that not only will it track your daily caloric consumptions and exercise, it will also track your symptoms

# Key Features:

- Exercise Log: Users can record their workouts, track calories burned, and see their progress over time. Whether it's a morning jog or a gym session, Health Harmony keeps you motivated and on track.
- Diet Log: With our comprehensive food database, users can log their meals with ease, keeping track of calories and nutrition. It's like having a dietitian in your pocket.
- Weight Log: Users can regularly log their weight, set goals, and monitor their journey towards their target weight, be it weight loss, gain, or maintenance.
