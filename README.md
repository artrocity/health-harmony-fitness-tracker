# Health Harmony Fitness Tracker

In today's fast-paced world, managing one's health and fitness often feels overwhelming. People struggle with keeping track of their exercise routines, dietary habits, body weight, and even daily health symptoms. Diagnosed with POTs (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome), I've personally experienced days of varied well-being without apparent reason. To address this, I'm excited to introduce Health Harmonyâ€”a comprehensive fitness tracker. Unlike other trackers, Health Harmony not only tracks your daily caloric consumptions and exercise but also your symptoms, offering insights into how lifestyle impacts overall well-being.

# Key Features:

Exercise Log: Record workouts, track calories burned, and monitor progress over time.
Diet Log: Log meals with ease using our comprehensive food database and keep track of calories and nutrition.
Weight Log: Regularly log weight, set goals, and monitor progress.
Symptom Tracker: Unique to Health Harmony, users can log daily health symptoms and their severity.
User Profile: Personalized profiles storing essential health metrics and preferences.
